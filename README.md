# AirMouse: Hands-Free Gesture Interface for Windows and Mac

## Scope
We are developing a program that allows users to control a computer mouse using hand gestures instead of physical contact. This system will enable users to move the cursor and 
We aim to implement a feature that allows users to execute actions without physically touching the computer. Additionally, we aim to let users type by tracing letters and numbers with their pointer finger. 

Our goal is to enhance accessibility and usability for individuals with mobility impairments (arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, etc.) when interacting with a computer.
